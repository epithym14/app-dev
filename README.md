*My favorite series is **Arcane** considering that it has excellent animation and visuals*. Packed with emotional depth, the narrative skillfully combines action and lore to make it both captivating for League enthusiasts just like meÂ and approachable for people new to it.  It's one of those rare series, in my opinion, where the character development and animation are so excellent that you can't help but become engrossed in every second. *If you enjoy complicated, character-driven narratives, you should definitely watch it.*
